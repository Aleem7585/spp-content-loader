== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What type of files does it import? =
Each article must be in it's own individual plain .txt file. The first line must consist of the article title followed by a blank line and the content. All these .txt files need to be zipped into one ZIP file. If still unsure, refer to the example ZIP file and its contents.

= The plugin won't upload my files, something about zip_open =
This plugin requires zip_open which is a feature that is installed in many web hosts' PHP. If you run into this problem, contact your web host to ask if zip_open is installed. If not, you might want to ask them to install it.

Please know that zip_open is not something we can install for you nor can you install it yourself in most cases especially on shared web hosting accounts. We do not have any further server configuration files. The best way is to work with your web host. Alternatively, you can contact us via http://techbasedsupport.com for premium level support and we will work together.
